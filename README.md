# ZK-SNARKs-zero2pro ðŸŒŒâœ¨

This repository contains curated materials to take you from zero knowledge to professional understanding of zkSNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Arguments of Knowledge), covering the essential mathematical foundations and cryptographic primitives.

## ðŸ“š Learning Path

The materials are organized in a progressive learning sequence with accompanying notes:

### 1. Foundations of Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC)
**Prerequisite knowledge for understanding zkSNARKs**

- [Elliptic Curve Cryptography - Session 1 - Cyber Security CSE4003](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWouocApQYk) - [ðŸ”–âœ¨ My Notes](./notes/Elliptic_Curve_Arithmetic.pdf)
- [Elliptic Curve Cryptography - Session 2 - Cyber Security - CSE4003](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vpPKvD3fBbY) - [ðŸ”–âœ¨ My Notes](./notes/Elliptic_Curve_Encryption&Decryption.pdf)  
  *This note includes SageMath code for message encryption using elliptic curves and how the receiver decrypts it.*
  
*These 2 videos cover point addition and scalar multiplication on elliptic curves, along with their fundamental applications in cryptography.*

### 2. Mathematical Foundations for Cryptography
**Essential group theory and algebraic structures**
